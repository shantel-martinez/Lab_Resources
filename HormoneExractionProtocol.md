### Extraction for Hormone Measurement (USDA-ARS MU 2017)      
*Author: Sven C. Nelson, PhD | Comments: Shantel A. Martinez, PhD*  
*This is the extraction of samples for ABA and GA (and GA precursor) measurement in Columbia, Missouri (USDA-ARS in Oliver Lab) using LCMS. Based on the protocol from RIKEN 2013, but with substitutions for tools that we do not have here. The 2016 version of this protocol used 15 mL tubes, but it has now been further modified to use **5 mL polypropylene round-bottomed tubes (Falcon, product: 352063)** for most steps. This allows speed-vac steps to accommodate 40 tubes at once with our new rotor for 5 mL tubes. For larger samples, refer to 15 mL or 50 mL tube protocols. (Max 400 mg sample : 50 mL tubes.)*

**1. Measure the weight of the freeze-dried samples in 5 mL tube.** (desired: 50-100 mg DW)  
>a. Do this beforehand. Pre-weigh empty tubes before adding ground tissue and then weigh again after freeze drying. Subtract the first from the second to get the total dry weight. Be sure to use the sensitive scale and record all 4 digits after the decimal for your pre-weights.

**2. Add 2 mL of the 1st extraction solution to each samples**   
>a. For all extraction solutions, use HPLC quality H2O. Don’t store extraction solution as it contains internal standards (ISs) which can degrade over time, make fresh.  
>b. 1st extraction solution: 80% Acetone containing 1% AcOH and IS-MIX solution  
>c. Add IS (GA and ABA internal standards) to extraction solution “master mix” so that each sample will get the desired final ng per sample. **Record the per-sample ng of IS added.**  
>d. **How much IS-MIX to add?** Decide based on amount of endogenous GA/ABA expected
>and peaks within the linear range of detection in test LCMS runs of ISs.  
>e. **Example:** If 7 μl final volume (per sample) and injecting 3 μl. If you desire 24 ng/injection, then there should be 56 ng/sample (24 × 7/3). However we are adding 2mL per samples, therefore 56/2 = 28 ng/1mL.

**Updating Software Sequence Info**  
1. `Sequence` `Sequence Parameters` Subdirectory: `NameDate` Click Prefix cell (will ask to create, `yes`). Prefix should be the file name `Date_01_` and the counter will start with `001`  
    Check post seq command: `STANDBY` For a single run. If I wanted to run multiple runs, and whaat to run right after one another. You can change WHILE your sequence is running. Uncheck it if I dont want the LCMS to go to standby.  `OK`  
2. `Sequence` `Sequence Table`  Click a cell and you can edit the cell. Input the pos into `vial` column. Highlight a row to cut it out. Insert to add more rows. Edit `Sample Name`, `Inj/Vial`, and `Method Name` needs to be my prefered method (all samples HAVE TO BE the same method). Once done, click `OK`  
>a. This can be done ahead of time during the extraction method.  

3. Once the dilution samples are dried down, re-suspend to  7uL in 1% AcOH in MeCN (Assuming your sample is to be diluted to a final volume of 7uL, this may change on your preference).  
4. Place the samples in the LCMS tray and record the position in the `sample sequence table` above. 
5. Double check `Sequqence Parameters`, and `Sequencec Table`

### LCMS Machine Run & Configuration   
The basis of the LC : sample/hormone will flow based on both the chemistry in the column AND the size.  
And the change of ratios of the solvents, you can push/pull out as slow or fast. Because if you have a low % solv B, things come out slower, but close peaks together seperate (more resolution of peaks close). But if you have a high % solvent B, things will come out faster. The same things with the disposal columns, but we arent keeping all, getting rid of things, this time we what to spread the hormones out, so when it gets shot out to the mass spec, it reads the masses.  

**1. LCMS Chemicals**  
First, Do we have enough solvents to run the LCMS
*Use HPLC graduate cylinder (in the hood). Rinse the cylinder with HPLC grade water before use*
When switching jars while on, turn the tube knob to waste

Turn knob back to column.  
***MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER WHEN CHANGING SOLVENTS***
When/if you change the solvents, you need to tel lthe computer how much is in the bottles. The machine will stop the run before it gets to 0mL.  
- Quant. Pump window click on the bottle letter. Ex: A change to 2.0 liters (full) with a max of 2.0 liters. 
- When you click, you can change all of the final volumes in the pop-up window.  
- Click Ok. Then the green liquid levels in the graphic will change.

<span style="color:#CD5C5C">**2. Turn on the pump 30min - 1hr before starting.**</span> 

- Start with turning on the machine with a lower pressure (0.5) `On`
- Once the temperature has reach around 60C, then change the pressure back to Method pressure: 1.0 (mL/min)

- SV_PHENYL150X3MM3UM_ABA_GA_SIM4_SHANTEL.M  (sven_columntype_hormones_methodversionnumber_user.M)
- the methos `scan` will look at anything with all masses (so anything will show up, more noise that I dont want). 
- `sim` allows us to specify the molecular weight of what we are looking for (i.e., ABA) and then the mass spec will only scan at that MW. So you can do this on all the hormones you want to look at.  

3. Specify or change a `Run Method` (*in our case, we exluded GA19*)  
    `Method` `save as` name the method in the folder `c:\chem32\1\methods`
    `Edit Entire Method` Leave all checked `OK` desciption of method you can edit but is not necessary `OK` ALS `OK`  
    We wont change the Solv A and B ratios, Keep the fow rate at 1.000 mL/min. `OK` `OK`  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temperature fluctuations can effect peaks, so he keeps a LEFT high temp at 60C.  And left and right are combined, so they both are the same. 
    Set Up MSD Signal :Setting up the masses and the retention times we want the MS to start looking for our specific mass.    
- general tune file: `atunes.tun` ALWAYS put it on this one, no matter what anyone else tells you. It points to the most recent tune file.   
- Mode `SIM` keep that mode  
- Polarity, ABA/GA are `negative`, if you dont know run one with negative and then again with positive to see where your peaks show best.   
- GA19 Group4 `Select` `cut` both lines   
- Change Group 6 from 5.6 to 5.5  And do the same for the IS GA19 samples `OK` `OK`   
- The retention times for the Internal Standard or "endogenous" standards are differeent than when you run the samples. 

Sample Purity: looking to M- no adduct (mass) and M-H (M - 1) in the negative tab since we are looking `OK` `OK` `OK`  
Specify Report: G6100 `Calssic Reporting` check `Screen`uncheck `File` and the Quantitation setting is set to certian numbers based on the injection amount we did (24 and 48).  And now everytime it runs, it should pop up on the screen. `OK` `OK` `OK` `OK` `OK` `OK`  
`Method` `Save Method` MUST BE DONE now, or it will not run with this new updated method, it will run with the old method. Comment if you would like `OK`    
Press giant `ON` button, hear a sound, thats the pump working. MS is still offline, when we actually start a run, the MS is online. and the temperatures are coming up to temperature.  
*Turn `ON` the MS* 
Eveything should turn green and be ready. Once everything is ready, The top left tab will be green `ready`  

4. Set up Sequence Parameters and Tables (see [intructions here](#LCMSSeq)).  
5. Double check `Sequqence Parameters`, and `Sequencec Table`,  `Method`, and then re- `Save Method` just in case. 
6. To start the run: `Run Control` `Run Sequence`
>a. If you ever need it to stop, you can press `Pause Sequence` then once it has paused after the current sample, THEN you can press`Stop Run/Inj...` and it will stop at the end of this sample (or the one following) but never in the middle of a sample. 

**General LCMS Notes**
Solvent B will go up in volume during the run, but Solvent A will constantly output the same volume, so solvent A always runs out quicker. 
`Documents` `Shantel`  `screenshot_logs`   
Label the files `date_columnname_hormone`
HP Computer has no internet, since the software needs to be run on window 7 and not upgraded (and USDA has a policy that all computers with a network must have windows 10)
