    "**Measuring Dry Weight for Hormone Extraction**   \n",
    "**Step 1:** Label each tube with an idenifing number. \n",
    "> My labeling system is just the numbers in the 1000's, and all of he tube information is found in a google worksheet.  \n",
    "> For the hormone extaction protocol, 5 mL polypropylene round-bottomed tubes (Falcon, product: 352063) is needed for downstream speed vac rotor size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE DATASHEET SET-UP\n",
    "![](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/Lab_Resources/blob/master/example_img/DatasheetEx.JPG?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Place tube holder (Below **Image A**) on the small balance.  \n",
    "**Step 3:** Close the balance door. Wait 20 seconds for the tube holder to steady. Tare the tube holder. \n",
    "> *From this point on, always be patient. The precise weight is more important than the time it takes to tare, wait, weigh, wait, etc.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Add the empty tube plus cap into the designated tube holding position. Close the balance door. Wait until the balance read stops on one value for 15+ seconds. \n",
    "> Changing where a tube is measured from tube to tube will result in inconsistent values, increasing the measuring error. So keep the position of the tube exactly the same for each tube, and preferably in the exact middle of the balance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Record the empty weight value into the datasheet column \"weight_empty\". Record all 4 digits past zero. Repeat steps 3-5 for each tube.  \n",
    "> The sample masses are key to determining the final concentration, so use the most sensitive scale that you have and record all 4 digits past the decimal.  (Ex. 7.0035g - 6.0125g = 0.091g) This information is used in the final data analysis to determine ng/g dry weight of the hormone in your samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Prep samples per experimental conditions   \n",
    "**Step 7:** Flash freeze samples in liquid N   \n",
    "**Step 8:** Grind in liquid N. Make sure tissue is well ground. Place in -80C for a minimum 2 hours.  \n",
    ">For dry seed tissue, add a few drops of water into the liquid N with the seeds before grinding to help break up the tissue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9:** Separate the lids and cover the tubes with parafilm that have poked holes from a tack.  \n",
    "**Step 10:** [Lyophilize](#Lyoph) ground sample for 48hrs (Below **Image B**).  \n",
    "**Step 11:** Replace tube lids with original lids (Below **Image C**). Keep track of which lid goes with which tube since each lid has a slightly different mass    \n",
    "**Step 12:** Weigh the tube with lid now containing the lyophilized sample as in **Steps 3-5** above. Record the sample weight value into the datasheet column \"weight_sample\". With the \"weight_sample\" minus the \"weight_empty\", we can get the actual mass of the lyophilized sample (column “dry_weight”).   \n",
    "**Step 13:** Parafilm the tubes tightly to prevent any sample from escaping and to prevent moisture entering during shipping.   \n",
    "**Step 14:** Store and ship the tubes wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent any hormone breakdown due to light. You can store and ship these samples at room temperature.  \n",

    "**DNA-free RNA Isolation For Wheat Seeds (adapted)**  \n",
    "Isolation of **Total RNA** optimized for wheat seeds in small microfuge tubes.  Protocol is based an Arabidopsis adaption heavily modified to optimize from Sven Nelson based off of a paper published by [Oñate-Sánchez and Vincent-Carbajosa in 2008](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/93).  For protocol ease, the procedure used for wheat has been left in, and the original protocol with the Arabidopsis notes and more thorough details are found [here](https://github.com/shantel-martinez/Cornell_PHS/blob/master/General%20Research%20Files/Protocols%20and%20Information/SOP%20Phenol-Chloroform%20RNA%20Extraction.v2.docx).      \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the (<span style=\"color:blue\">blue text</span>) to help you prep ahead of time and reduce total extraction time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*As with any RNA extraction, use extreme caution of RNase contamination.  DEPC-treat any chemicals that you prepare.  For chemicals like Tris that you cannot DEPC-treat, use DEPC’d water to prepare it.  Prepare an RNase-Free zone on your bench where no one will enter and you will never touch with bare hands (<span style=\"color:blue\">do ONCE day before</span>; No need to repeat unless the area has been obviously contaminated or a long time has passed).  You can buy fancy wipes or solutions to wipe this area down, but if you don’t have these, a low percentage bleach solution will work to remove RNases.  Some sources suggest using SDS in water will denature RNases, but this is not recommended.  SDS will partially denature the RNases and then wiping it will spread these still-partially-active RNases around your bench causing more harm than good.  Always wear gloves from a fresh box and use other precautions, but remember also that some of this is overkill and we do it to be extra-safe.  If you happen to touch a tube with your bare hand do not assume that this means that the experiment has failed and toss the tube.  It is likely that one touch will not destroy your sample.  Also, there will be instances where you will have no choice but to use a less-than-RNase-Free zone, such as when using the hood or when storing things in a -20ºC communal freezer.*  \n",

    "----Day 1----  \n",
    "**Sample preparation (grinding tissue):**  \n",
    "*Grinding the tissue is the most important step of the RNA extraction.  You need to get your tissue completely ground without allowing it to defrost.  You do not want to see any tissue start to get soggy.  Keep applying liquid nitrogen as you grind to keep tissue frozen, this requires some care as the liquid nitrogen can cause the sample to splatter up out of the tube or mortar.  Avoid this.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Grind 20mg dry seed in liquid nitrogen and get sample into a 1.5mL microfuge tube (<span style=\"color:blue\">label tubes morning of</span>). For wheat seeds, use both method a. or method b. Method A will get the samples/tissue into a fine powder, which are placed into a cooled microfuge tubes. Then method b will grind the samples more thoroughly with the dremel.    \n",
    ">a. Use a pre-cooled mortar and pestle (<span style=\"color:blue\">prep day before</span>).  Scrape the ground tissue out and place in an eppendorf tube without allowing it to defrost.  As best as possible, reduce the amount  material lost in transfer from mortar and pestle to tube.    \n",
    ">\n",
    ">b. Then grind the seed in the microfuge tube that has been pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen (backflip easy open tubes work well, but don’t seal as tightly).  To pre-cool: Used a metal block with holes for tubes (from a broken tube incubator).  Place this in a styrofoam box and surround with ice (mainly for stability), then flood with liquid nitrogen to cool the block.  Place the open tubes in the block and fill with liquid nitrogen (liqN2) until the bubbling ceases.  This indicates that they have cooled sufficiently (<span style=\"color:blue\">prep right before grinding</span>).  While some liquid nitrogen remains in the tube, carefully add your sample to the tube.  You may wish to cover the top with a metal spatula to prevent the splattering liqN2 from ejecting your samples.  Allow liqN2 to stop bubbling in the tube and when most of the liqN2 has evaporated, grind with a plastic conical tipped head coupled to a handheld dremel (drill-like tool; <span style=\"color:blue\">charge day before </span>).  Wiping the head with 70% EtOH between samples is sufficient to prevent cross-contamination and RNase-degradation.  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">*There are commercial products available for this, but a household Dremel will work just as well and cost much less.  When buying a household dremel, a battery powered model is preferred as the cord can get in the way and contaminate your RNase-free area.  In addition to this, I believe the battery powered models tend to be less powerful, the corded models may burn through your tubes.  If you have the option of one with a high-low speed switch this will allow you to optimize the speed if you are worried about burning through your tubes.  Grinding is pretty much instant, no need to hold the grinding head at the bottom for more than a few seconds.  No time for the sample to defrost.   \n",
    ">**To get optimal yield:** (for Arabidopsis seeds) grind a little longer until you see the sample coat the wall of the tube and it appears that it is “wet.”  Ensure that the tube is still cool, however, you don’t want to heat up the sample sue to friction.  The wetness is most likely the oils from the seed being released.  When you grind this way you will need to scrape some seem material off of the grinding tip after grinding, but it will more than double your yield (600ng/µl → 1200ng/µl).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Immediately add 550µl Extraction Buffer (<span style=\"color:blue\">prep all buffers and aliquot liquids day before </span>) and move to the fume hood to add 550µl chloroform.  Vortex 10 seconds. (**Do not allow sample to defrost before adding the buffer.**)  You may need to stick a pipet tip into the tube to scrape some material off of the edge if you used the optimized grinding method.   \n",

    "> iii. If you have more than 4 samples for this extraction, then keep the cooled metal block cold.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Move vortexed tube (looks like milkshake) to ice if you will have **4 samples or less** to extract; if you will have **more than 4 samples** for this extraction, then place the first tube in the liqN2 cooled metal block that you used for grinding. Then repeat steps 1 and 2 again with the remaining samples.  Place sample #2 and higher in the liqN2 cooled metal block.  The samples in the liqN2 cooled metal block will freeze instantly.  \n",
    "> Once all samples are ground and in Extraction Buffer and chloroform, proceed to step 4.  **Step 4 through 10 must be done 1 tube at a time.**  You will need to make balances for centrifugation, but if you do even 4 tubes in parallel you are likely to see a decrease in yield from the 1st to the 4th tube.  Leave the remaining tubes in the metal block (add liqN2 periodically to keep cool).   \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:purple\">Take Lunch if 4+ samples are being extracted.</span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Remove the sample that is on ice and vortex briefly to ensure there are no ice chunks present.  Move the next sample in line from the liqN2 metal block to the ice box to defrost (should return to a liquid milkshake by the time you need to use it) and spin the sample 3 min at top speed in a tabletop microcentrifuge (≈13,000 rpm) at RT.  \n",
    "> Once skilled and familiar with the protocol, you can do 2 samples at a time. So samples #1 and #2 were thawed at the same time, vortexed, and centrifuged together. While sample #3 and #4 are placed on ice to thaw. This is the MAX overlap you should do. Any more may result in error due to time it takes to continue the protocol.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Transfer aqueous (top) layer to a fresh tube.  Because you will do two subsequent organic:aqueous separations, you can carefully suck the aqueous layer all the way down to the interphase division formed by the cell debris.  \n",
    "**Step 6:** (in hood) Add 500µl of water-saturated acidic phenol (it is important not to use pH 6.6 buffered phenol for this, instead use pH 4.5).  Vortex thoroughly after adding phenol.  Add 200µl of chloroform and 8µl of iso-amyl alcohol.  Vortex briefly, but thoroughly. (**This step is important:** if you do not mix thoroughly you will get 3 layers after spinning, if you do you will get 2 layer with a very clear interphase.)  Spin 3 min top speed at RT.   \n",
    "**Step 7:** VERY CAREFULLY, remove the aqueous (top) layer to a new tube.  **Do this right away, do not let the tube sit.**  Do not suck all the way down to the interphase. (I usually get about 500µl) You want to avoid getting any phenol carry over at this step.  **But**, phenol is very slightly soluble in water, so a small portion of phenol will have gone into the aqueous phase.  In order to remove this we need to do one final chloroform extraction.  \n",
    "**Step 8:** Add equal volume (for me, 500µl) of chloroform to the tube and vortex thoroughly.  (*Again, **it is important to vortex thoroughly** if you want this step to have any effect.  We want to pull the last little bit of phenol out of the aqueous layer*).  Then… either a. or b. below.  \n",
    ">a.\tFor best results, use Phase Lock Gel (PLG) tubes (from 5Prime).  After vortexing, transfer sample with chloroform to a pre-spun PLG tube (<span style=\"color:blue\">spin morning off</span>).  Spin down for 3 min top speed at RT.  \n",
    ">b.\tYou can still get great results if you simply spin down the tube at this point (3 min top speed at RT.) (*just be more careful in the next step as noted.*)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9:** Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube.  If you have used a PLG tube then you can suck all of the aqueous layer out safely with no worry for organic contamination.  If you did not then just be careful when sucking the top layer off, don’t suck down too close to the interphase and don’t let the tube sit before transferring the aqueous layer as phenol can come out into the top layer if it sits too long (*although unlikely at this point*).  \n",
    "**Step 10:** Now comes the moment of truth: Add ⅓ volume (for me this was ≈167µl) of 8M LiCl to the tube and invert to mix.  If you get a white precipitant immediately then you have phenol contamination.  **This means you didn’t vortex thoroughly as instructed.** Don’t panic, you can still save your sample, but you will get lower yield.  But if you **do not** see an obvious white precipitant (the white will be obvious, very faint cloudiness or schlieren lines are ok) then you will have phenol-contamination free extractions.  Precipitate at -20ºC for 2 hours minimum.  You will get best yield by precipitating overnight.  **At this point go back to step 4 and repeat steps 4 through 10 until all samples are at -20ºC.  Store for a minimum of 2 hour from last sample.**  \n",

    "----Day 2----  \n",
    "**Step 11:** Spin 30 minutes at **4ºC** at 13,000 rpm to recover pellet (<span style=\"color:blue\">cool centri. morning of</span>). A visible brown pellet is a good sign.   \n",
    ">a.\tAt the same time, take 10x DNase buffer and from the -20ºC and place it on ice.  The buffer will be frozen and needs to thaw before use.  Place RNase-free DNase I in a stay-cold container (like Stratagene’s StrataCooler Benchtop Coolers) in the freezer ready to take out when you want to use it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 12:** Discard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in 26µl DEPC-treated water.  If pellet is hard to dissolve by flicking the tube (no vortex) then add a 10 minute step at 37ºC to allow it to dissolve more before adding DNase.  \n",
    "> **If you had a white precipitant in step 11:** After the spin you will see the white precipitant at the bottom with the pellet.  When removing supernatant suck in some liquid and gently “blow” this at the white precipitant.  The phenol will come off in organic bubble droplets fairly easily.  Make sure to remove all of these droplets.  Unfortunately, you will lose some RNA in this step if you do this, but even if you feel like you have harshly blown everything away and your tube looks like it has no pellet, you will still probably get a fair amount of RNA, maybe in the 40-60ng/µl range.  If you are careful, you can still get around 150ng/µl yields consistently this way.  After resuspending pellet look for any (very small) organic droplets floating around.  If they exist, remove them with a 2µl pippetman.  If you are careful, you will still get good quality uncontaminated RNA)  \n",

    "**Step 13:** For Zymo Research Cat# E1007: Add 6.5µl 10x DNase buffer (<span style=\"color:blue\">thaw on ice morning of</span>) and 3.25µl RNase-free DNase I to each sample (no thaw needed, can use straight from the -20C).  Incubate at 37ºC for 30 minutes.  \n",
    "> **Important:** Adjust quantities of Buffer and DNase to the recommendation for the brand of your DNase based on a 65µl reaction.   \n",
    ">This step removes any remaining genomic DNA.  With only 1µl of DNase I, I still saw some genomic DNA contamination on occasion.  \n",

    "**Step 17:** Wash with 70% EtOH: Add ≈100µl of 70% EtOH and let it wash over the pellet, then suck it up right away and discard.  Do not try to dissolve the pellet in the 70% EtOH.  \n",
    "**Step 18:** Air-dry open tubes on bench.  (For about 10 minutes, until fairly dry, RNA pellet will not turn white or otherwise change.)  \n",
