If I ever want to published raw data files, the script to organize and analyze the data, all the way down to producing the final figures, I know from personal experience that I need to be extremely organized, and I am starting [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06008-w?utm_source=twt_nr&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=NNPnature). I have high admiration for scientists that are very transparent, and I dream of getting to the point of publishing a github repo with every raw data file with 'clean' script for the public to follow. So, I'm working on those skills, and these [articles](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) on how to tidy up my script are also a good start.    \n",
